The dataset comes from the *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartophones Dataset*.  A reference is given below.

I merged the training and the test sets from the X_train and X_test files to create one data set. I also read the subject_train, subject_test, activity_train, activity_test files. 

I extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  To do this, I used a regex expression to choose variables with "mean" or "std" in the file name.  Perhaps if I had a better understanding what these measurements actually represented I could be more specific.  As is, I suspect there are a few of these columns are derived from other columns.  

To label the activities with names instead of numbers, I found all instances of the number 1,2,3, etc and substituted in the appropriate activity name.

For variable names I used the variable names from the features.txt file, because frankly they seem about as descriptive as they can be.  People have opinions about what type of special characters can/cannot be in a file name, but those opinions vary a lot. I see no reason to do heroic regex to get them into an arbitrary format for a class assignment.  R did change any "()" characters to ".." characters when giving the columns names, I suspect because "()" would make names look like functions, that don't exist.

Finally, I created an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. I used the group_by and summarize_all commands to get the desired averages, and wrote the output to a text file.
